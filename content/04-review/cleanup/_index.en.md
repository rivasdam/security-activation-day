In order to prevent charges to your account we recommend cleaning up the infrastructure that was created. If you plan to keep things running so you can examine the workshop a bit more please remember to do the cleanup when you are done. It is very easy to leave things running in an AWS account, forgot about it, and then accrue charges.  

{{% notice tip %}}
If you are using this in an instructor led session, with AWS Event Engine you do not need to run the cleanup steps.
